Module: DevOps for Developers
</h1>

<br/>

<h5 align="center">
The main goal of the module will be to present the basic concepts of DevOps in a Linux environment. This will be achieved through an introduction to the discipline, supported by both theoretical and practical acquaintance with some of the commonly used tools that form the foundation of most DevOps practices. During the two courses of the module, topics such as virtualization, containerization, and automation of core processes like provisioning, configuring, monitoring, etc., will be addressed. Methods and tools for teamwork, creating, combining, and utilizing code from more than one person simultaneously will also be presented.
